<h3><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">What is sfZed?</font></h3>
<font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">sfZed is an editor for the sfz
format for the sfz sample player created by rgc:audio and for CakeWalk
Dimension. The format uses stand   alone samples as wave or ogg files, plus a
file defining how those samples  should be used.  The sfz format is a text
format and can be edited with  a text editor. The role of sfZed is to make
that task easier by organising  the information, providing graphical visual
feedback and audio auditioning.  Since it is desirable to be able to convert
equivalent formats, conversion  is also included.</font>

<h3><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Settings</font></h3>
<font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">When sfZed starts it will prompt
you for some settings. These are:<br>
<br>
</font>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">     MIDI In - choose a
    suitable input MIDI device. If there are none or you choose  to have
    none, leave it blank. You can use the built in keyboard.<br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">     Audio - choose a
    suitable output audio device. If there is none or you choose   to have
    none, you must select "No sfz auditioning" below.<br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">     Sfz dll file - Choose
    the path to your sfz VST dll. If you don't have one, download it from
    www.rgcaudio.com. Again,  otherwise you must select "No sfz auditioning"
    below.<br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">     No sfz auditioning -
    check this box to have no sfz auditioning. You may wish  to do this if
    you have problems with auditioning.</font></li>
</ul>
<font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Also you can choose whether to save
&lt;group&gt; values with regions. By default this will be set to "One group
only" which means that any values which are the same thoughout all regions
wll appear in a &lt;group&gt; tag at the top of the file. If "Multiple
groups" chosen sfZed will detect which opcodes are suitable for grouping
using the current sort order and create groups where appropriate</font>. <br>


<h3><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Creating a new
instrument</font></h3>
<font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">When you first open sfZed it has
created the basis for a new instrument. It creates one region which is mapped
 right across the keyboard, but has no samples associated with it. In place
of the sample is an "Add" button. By clicking that, or choosing "Add samples"
 from the "File" menu, one or more samples can be added. In fact sfZed simply
 creates a reference to the location of each sample.  In place of the  "Add"
button, there will now be a dropdown selection of all of the available
samples. At the time the samples are added, you will be prompted to add
regions.  This creates one region for each sample, and, as far as it can tell
from the name, sets the lokey, hikey and pitch_keycenter (see Working with
Templates below). It then opens the region toolbox and offers to spread the
samples across available keys and set the velocity range if you wish. <br>
<br>
To create a new region choose "New region" from the "Edit" menu.<br>
</font>

<h3></h3>

<h3><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Working with
Templates</font></h3>
<font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">The values associated with a region
can be saved for use in other editing sessions. This can be most useful when
mapping drums which need special setting for each part of the kit. A template
is created by right clicking on a region and choosing Template&gt;Set. Enter
the template keyword and click Add/Update. All of the values in the selected
region are now saved against that keyword. The keyword becomes a menu option
under Template and selecting it will apply  the values to a region.<br>
</font><br>
<font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Also, when samples are loaded, the
template keywords are compared with the sample name, and if one matches any
part of the name the template will be automatically  applied. In this
respect, note names and numbers are also treated as keywords  and if there is
more than one match, the longest match will take priority,  and where lengths
are equal templates take priority.</font><br>
<br>
<font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">For example  a template with a
keyword of "kick" will automatically assign the required  opcode values to a
sample called "kick23.wav", or be applied with one mouse  click if it isn't.
 If you dont want a keyword to ever be matched to  a sample name put a "*" or
"?"  in the name.<br>
<br>
When you create your first template a file called "sfztemplates.sfz" is
created in the directory where sfZed.exe is loaded. It can be loaded into
sfZed like any other file, edited and saved.<br>
<br>
No templates are provided by default, but I will host templates on this web
site if anyone wants to share them.</font>

<h3><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Selection</font></h3>
<font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Individual cells can be selected
just by clicking on them once. They can be copied, pasted etc. By clicking on
the far left margin, whole regions can be selected. They can be copied and
pasted also. If regions are copied, and then pasted into a text document,
proper sfz format regions will be produced. Similarly if one or more regions
is copied from a text document (including the &lt;region&gt; tag) they can
be successfully pasted into sfZed. To select all regions, click the empty
top left cell of the Region tab.<br>
<br>
When pasting in individual cells, the selection position moves down by one.
This means that by repeated pasting, a number of cells can be quickly filled
with the same value. To make all of the cells in an opcode have the  same
value, right click on a cell with the value required, and choose "Apply  to
all".<br>
</font>

<h3><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Auditioning</font></h3>
<font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Auditioning will not be available
until you have saved a new instrument for the first time as an sfz format
file (or saved a converted Soundfont). Once you have done so it will be
available automatically, and the sound will be produced through sfz, giving
an accurate reflection of the end result. As you play notes, the region being
used will be highlighted in green on the left. This is an indication of the
regions, not always an accurate reflection of what sfz is using. Not all
aspects of  sfz are modeled, and some (eg random regions) could not be
predicted by sfZed.<br>
<br>
When you make changes, the notes are highlighted in red. This means what you
are hearing is the copy before the changes were made. To hear the changes,
either save the file, or click the "Preview" button, which will have turned
red. Preview creates a temporary file, without changing the original.<br>
<br>
The "Sfz" tab shows the sfz VST. Here you can choose the quality settings.
Loading a different file here will do no harm, but will not be understood by
the editor.<br>
<br>
On the toolbar there is also a volume slider, and a keyboard button which
opens a keyb</font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">oard window
which can be resized,  as an alt</font><font
face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">ernative to MIDI input. An advantage of
this is that a range of velocities are available which may be difficult to
reproduce on a MIDI keyboard.<br>
<br>
</font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Also the following keys will
play the currently selected  region:<br>
<br>
F5 - lowest key, highest velocity<br>
F6 - highest key, highest velocity<br>
F7 - middle key, lowest velocity (1 if low velocity is 0 - though still
probably inaudible)<br>
F8 - middle key, highest velocity</font><font
face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
</font>

<h3><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Setting values</font></h3>

<p><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">The sfz format defines a lot of
"Opcodes" which define how the samples should be played back. See the sfz
format definition at www.rgcaudio.com for details. By creating many regions,
different samples and settings can be used based on the note played, and
perhaps, say, its velocity. The remaining settings affect the way the sound
is played back. All of these (about 200 possible opcodes) are available from
the "Opcodes" menu and become new columns in the layout. By hovering your
mouse over a column, or right-clicking and choosing "Help" more information
about the opcode is available. But you should use the formal sfz format
definition  in case of doubt.<br>
<br>
Values can be set depending on their type. Numeric values can mostly be  set
using a slider. But if there is no upper or lower limit this is not
available.  Choices appear as a dropdown. But any cell can be modified just
by typing  the value required.</p>

<p><span style="color: #993300; background-color: #FFFFFF">Cell values which
are notes can also be set by holding down Ctrl and playing them on the MIDI
keyboard. Where notes are high/low pairs, both can be set at the same time by
playing both notes.</span><br>
<br>
When a value has the defined default for that opcode it is coloured grey and
it will be omitted from the saved file. Values in red are invalid for that
opcode type (but will still be saved if you save the file).<br>
<br>
Comments at the top of the sfz file can be modified via the Comments tab.
Comments within the file cannot be modified, but are retained a far as
possible. <font color="#993300"><span style="color: #000000">Two special
comments are available</span><br style="color: #000000">
<br style="color: #000000">

<h3><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Soundfont Conversion</font></h3>
<font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">The most 'open' format prior to
sfz is the Creative Soundfont, and it is supported by all converters. So
sfZed includes the ability to convert Soundfonts.<br>
<br>
Converting Soundfonts does not achieve anything useful in itself. If you
plan to use them unaltered, leave them as Soundfonts. Conversion is there
for cases where you want to apply changes. Also remember that if you plan
to share your results, Soundfonts (and samples for that matter) may be
protected   by copyright.<br>
<br>
To convert a Soundfont, choose "Import Soundfont". If it contains more than
one instrument you will be asked which you wish to convert. Only one can be
converted at a time. The sfz format created from a Soundfont cannot be
auditioned until it, and the samples have been saved. The opcodes in sfz  do
not exactly match the options available in a Soundfont, so the result may not
exactly match.<br>
<br>
Where possible, sfZed will create a stereo sample where the Soundfont uses
stereo, even if that means some loss of parameters as a result. It can only
do so, however, if the samples are alike in all respects, including loop
points. Otherwise it will create two mono samples and pan them as in the
Soundfont - but the results in sfz will not be so good as a stereo
sample.</font>
